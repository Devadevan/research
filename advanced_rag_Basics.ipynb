requirements within the maxi mum permissible time will be \\\\ndeemed to be automatically terminated from the program. Students facing disciplinary action for any serious \\\\noffence (example ragging) may also face premature termination from the program, if so recommended by the \\\\ndisciplinary a ction committee.  \\\\n \\\\nA student whose Program is terminated may appeal to the Chairperson, Senate, for reinstatement in the Program. \\\\nIn cases of termination due to inadequate academic performance, the student should clearly explain causes for the \\\\npoor perform ance, including how those causes will not adversely affect her/his performance in the future. The \\\\nSenate shall take a final decision about reconsideration of termination after considering all available inputs; the \\\\ntermination of the student remains in effe ct till otherwise recommended by the senate.  \\\\n \\\\nStudents who do not register for more than 2 consecutive semesters without information/prior approval will be \\\\nterminated. However, the student may appeal within one month from the date of termination notice  for \\\\nconsideration . Additionally, b eyond tenure students with backlogs and not having any Academic progress (e.g., not \\\\npassing even 25% of backlog credits) in two consecutive semesters will be terminated from the program.  \\\\n \\\\n4.3 Additional Options for Academically Motivated Students  \\\\n4.3.1 Additional and Audit Courses  \\\\nOn top of the prescribed curriculum a student can also opt for doing additional courses. These courses and their \\\\ngrades will also be mentioned in the transcript of the student (but will not be considered in the CGPA calculation).  \\\\nThe students with less than 7.0 CGPA are not allowed to register additional (extra) courses than their respective \\\\nnominal semester course load  \\\\nSimilarly, a student can also Audit a cours e; audit is similar to additional courses  except for that the grade will be \\\\nshown as AU in the transcript.  \\\\n \\\\n\\\\n29 \\\\n 4.3.2 BTech Teaching Assistantship   \\\\nInterested senior undergraduate students with a good CGPA can act as Teaching Assistants for beginner courses. \\\\nDepartment may decide the criteria for Teaching Assistantship. Usually, the students are expected to put in six \\\\nhours of work every week for this.  No stipend will be provided for this work. However, a certificate of appreciation \\\\nwill be issued in this rega rd from the Director.  \\\\n \\\\n4.3.3 Honor/ Minor  \\\\nA UG student can enrol for Minor program in a department other than his/her parent department and Honors \\\\nprogram in parent department. Following are the guidelines:  \\\\n\\\\u25cf In order to earn a minor degree, a student has to earn a minimum of 12 extra credits from a basket of courses \\\\nprescribed for each minor stream (if a student has already done some of the required courses as free electives \\\\nbefore, he may approach DU GC/ Concerned Department for equivalent credits).  \\\\n\\\\u25cf In ord er to earn honors degree, a student has to earn a minimum of 12 extra credits in the student\\\\u2019s major \\\\ndepartment out of which six credits will be from the project  courses.  \\\\n\\\\u25cf Minor registration has to be done before the Add period of 5th Semester (1 -2 segment) . \\\\n\\\\u25cf Minor:  Intake will be m inimum 5 Nos. or 10% of intake of the host department (whichever is higher)  and the \\\\nselection will be based on the IV semester CGPA.  SUGC, convener will be the overall coordinator for centralizing \\\\nthe selections and the Academic office will help.  \\\\n\\\\u25cf A student can enrol for Honor in fifth or sixth semester, depending on the policy of the department.  \\\\n\\\\u25cf A student can also enrol for both Minor  & Honors or for two Minors.  \\\\n\\\\u25cf A student must have cleared all outstanding backlogs by the time of enrolment into Minor/ Honors.  \\\\n\\\\u25cf After enrolling into Honor/ Minor, if a student gets Fail (F) grade in more than 3 credits his/ her enrolment  to \\\\nthe same will be terminated.  \\\\n\\\\u25cf The main transcript will only show the basic CGPA corresponding to the minimum requirement for the degree. \\\\nThe Minors/ Honors courses will be listed separately  in the transcript and carry a separate CGPA.  \\\\n\\\\u25cf Honors will be reflected in the deg ree certificate as \\\\u201c BTech in XYZ Engineering (Honors) \\\\u201d. Similarly, Minor as \\\\n\\\\u201cBTech in XYZ Engineering with Minor in ABC\\\\u201d. If a student has done both honors & minor, it will be \\\\nacknowledged as \\\\u201c BTech in XYZ Engineering (Honors) with Minor in ABC \\\\u201d.

Two minor s will be reflected as \\\\n\\\\u201cBTech in XYZ Engineering with Minor in ABC and Minor in DEF\\\\u201d.  \\\\n\\\\u25cf CGPA criteria for Honors can be set by the respective Departments.  \\\\n\\\\u25cf Departments offering Minors can put an upper limit (10% of the dept. intake) on the number of Minor st udents \\\\nthey wish to take. The students have to understand that since the number of seats available for each of the \\\\nMinor will be limited, one has to compete for a place; he/ she thus cannot ignore the basic CGPA.  \\\\n\\\\u25cf If a student drops from the Minor program, they can convert 3 credits earned in the minor program into free \\\\nelectives if he/she has completed the two third number of total credits as Minor otherwise they will remain \\\\nadditional. These additional courses will find mention in the transcript. In such c ases, the student may choose \\\\nbetween any of the three following options (a) show the actual grade (b) show the course with just a \\\\u201cpass\\\\u201d \\\\ngrade (c) omit the mentioning of the course.  \\\\n\\\\u25cf If a student drops from the Honors program, they can convert the earned 3 credits into free or department \\\\nelectives; if he/she has completed the two third number of total credits in Honors degree otherwise they will \\\\nremain additional. These additional courses will find mention in the transcript. In such cases, the student may \\\\nchoose between any of the three following options (a) show the actual grade (b) show the course with just a \\\\n\\\\u201cpass\\\\u201d grade (c) omit the mentioning of the course.  \\\\n \\\\n4.3.4 Double Major  \\\\nDouble major means a student can get a BTech degree mentioning two different departments at the same time. A \\\\nstudent may join the IITH in any particular discipline. S/he may then do the required additional courses in a another \\\\ndiscipline as well to earn BT ech degrees from each of those disciplines. An additional one year is permitted for the \\\\nstudent to complete these additional requirements. The following are some of the rules related to this program:  \\\\n\\\\u25cf An additional 24 credits as listed by the another depar tment needs to be completed by the student. the \\\\nsecond -department may also list an additional set of prer equisite courses in some cases.  \\\\n\\\\u25cf Intake: Minimum 5 Nos. or 10% of intake of the host department (whichever is higher) and the selection will \\\\nbe based on  the IV semester CGPA. SUGC, convener will be the overall coordinator for centralizing the \\\\nselections and the Academic office will help.  \\\\n\\\\n30 \\\\n \\\\u25cf The Double Major registration has to be done before the Add period of 5th Semester (1 -2 segment).  \\\\n\\\\u25cf Students can also sta rt accumulating course credits in the form of additional courses and convert them to be \\\\ncounted in favour of Double Major requirements at the time of enrolling into this program.  \\\\n\\\\u25cf The student should not have any backlogs.  \\\\n\\\\u25cf Each (second) department can set a cap on the maximum number of students who can avail this option.  \\\\n\\\\u25cf A student cannot do double -major and minor in the same department.  \\\\n\\\\u25cf If a student registers for Double Major (but not for a Minor), completes a few courses, and then opts out of a \\\\ndouble maj or, say, after completing 12 credits, and if these 12 credits also happen to be listed in the Minors \\\\nbasket of courses, then the student should be awarded a Minor.  \\\\n\\\\u25cf After enrolling into double -major, if a student gets Fail (F) grade in more than 3 credits h is/ her enrolment to \\\\nthe same will be terminated.  \\\\n\\\\u25cf The nomenclature for award of  Double Major d egree for the depar tments which doesn\\\\u2019t offer BTech program \\\\nwill be - \\\\u2018BTech in ABC and Second Major in XYZ\\\\u2019  \\\\n\\\\u25cf Similar to Minor/ Honors rules, if a student opts out  of the Double Major program, they can convert at most 6 \\\\ncredits into free electives if he/she has completed the two third number of total credits as Double Major \\\\notherwise they will remain additional.

requirements within the maxi mum permissible time will be \\\\ndeemed to be automatically terminated from the program. Students facing disciplinary action for any serious \\\\noffence (example ragging) may also face premature termination from the program, if so recommended by the \\\\ndisciplinary a ction committee.  \\\\n \\\\nA student whose Program is terminated may appeal to the Chairperson, Senate, for reinstatement in the Program. \\\\nIn cases of termination due to inadequate academic performance, the student should clearly explain causes for the \\\\npoor perform ance, including how those causes will not adversely affect her/his performance in the future. The \\\\nSenate shall take a final decision about reconsideration of termination after considering all available inputs; the \\\\ntermination of the student remains in effe ct till otherwise recommended by the senate.  \\\\n \\\\nStudents who do not register for more than 2 consecutive semesters without information/prior approval will be \\\\nterminated. However, the student may appeal within one month from the date of termination notice  for \\\\nconsideration . Additionally, b eyond tenure students with backlogs and not having any Academic progress (e.g., not \\\\npassing even 25% of backlog credits) in two consecutive semesters will be terminated from the program.  \\\\n \\\\n4.3 Additional Options for Academically Motivated Students  \\\\n4.3.1 Additional and Audit Courses  \\\\nOn top of the prescribed curriculum a student can also opt for doing additional courses. These courses and their \\\\ngrades will also be mentioned in the transcript of the student (but will not be considered in the CGPA calculation).  \\\\nThe students with less than 7.0 CGPA are not allowed to register additional (extra) courses than their respective \\\\nnominal semester course load  \\\\nSimilarly, a student can also Audit a cours e; audit is similar to additional courses  except for that the grade will be \\\\nshown as AU in the transcript.  \\\\n \\\\n\\\\n29 \\\\n 4.3.2 BTech Teaching Assistantship   \\\\nInterested senior undergraduate students with a good CGPA can act as Teaching Assistants for beginner courses. \\\\nDepartment may decide the criteria for Teaching Assistantship. Usually, the students are expected to put in six \\\\nhours of work every week for this.  No stipend will be provided for this work. However, a certificate of appreciation \\\\nwill be issued in this rega rd from the Director.  \\\\n \\\\n4.3.3 Honor/ Minor  \\\\nA UG student can enrol for Minor program in a department other than his/her parent department and Honors \\\\nprogram in parent department. Following are the guidelines:  \\\\n\\\\u25cf In order to earn a minor degree, a student has to earn a minimum of 12 extra credits from a basket of courses \\\\nprescribed for each minor stream (if a student has already done some of the required courses as free electives \\\\nbefore, he may approach DU GC/ Concerned Department for equivalent credits).  \\\\n\\\\u25cf In ord er to earn honors degree, a student has to earn a minimum of 12 extra credits in the student\\\\u2019s major \\\\ndepartment out of which six credits will be from the project  courses.  \\\\n\\\\u25cf Minor registration has to be done before the Add period of 5th Semester (1 -2 segment) . \\\\n\\\\u25cf Minor:  Intake will be m inimum 5 Nos. or 10% of intake of the host department (whichever is higher)  and the \\\\nselection will be based on the IV semester CGPA.  SUGC, convener will be the overall coordinator for centralizing \\\\nthe selections and the Academic office will help.  \\\\n\\\\u25cf A student can enrol for Honor in fifth or sixth semester, depending on the policy of the department.  \\\\n\\\\u25cf A student can also enrol for both Minor  & Honors or for two Minors.  \\\\n\\\\u25cf A student must have cleared all outstanding backlogs by the time of enrolment into Minor/ Honors.  \\\\n\\\\u25cf After enrolling into Honor/ Minor, if a student gets Fail (F) grade in more than 3 credits his/ her enrolment  to \\\\nthe same will be terminated.  \\\\n\\\\u25cf The main transcript will only show the basic CGPA corresponding to the minimum requirement for the degree. \\\\nThe Minors/ Honors courses will be listed separately  in the transcript and carry a separate CGPA.  \\\\n\\\\u25cf Honors will be reflected in the deg ree certificate as \\\\u201c BTech in XYZ Engineering (Honors) \\\\u201d. Similarly, Minor as \\\\n\\\\u201cBTech in XYZ Engineering with Minor in ABC\\\\u201d. If a student has done both honors & minor, it will be \\\\nacknowledged as \\\\u201c BTech in XYZ Engineering (Honors) with Minor in ABC \\\\u201d.

The students have to understand that since the number of seats available for each of the \\\\nMinor will be limited, one has to compete for a place; he/ she thus cannot ignore the basic CGPA.  \\\\n\\\\u25cf If a student drops from the Minor program, they can convert 3 credits earned in the minor program into free \\\\nelectives if he/she has completed the two third number of total credits as Minor otherwise they will remain \\\\nadditional. These additional courses will find mention in the transcript. In such c ases, the student may choose \\\\nbetween any of the three following options (a) show the actual grade (b) show the course with just a \\\\u201cpass\\\\u201d \\\\ngrade (c) omit the mentioning of the course.  \\\\n\\\\u25cf If a student drops from the Honors program, they can convert the earned 3 credits into free or department \\\\nelectives; if he/she has completed the two third number of total credits in Honors degree otherwise they will \\\\nremain additional. These additional courses will find mention in the transcript. In such cases, the student may \\\\nchoose between any of the three following options (a) show the actual grade (b) show the course with just a \\\\n\\\\u201cpass\\\\u201d grade (c) omit the mentioning of the course.  \\\\n \\\\n4.3.4 Double Major  \\\\nDouble major means a student can get a BTech degree mentioning two different departments at the same time. A \\\\nstudent may join the IITH in any particular discipline. S/he may then do the required additional courses in a another \\\\ndiscipline as well to earn BT ech degrees from each of those disciplines. An additional one year is permitted for the \\\\nstudent to complete these additional requirements. The following are some of the rules related to this program:  \\\\n\\\\u25cf An additional 24 credits as listed by the another depar tment needs to be completed by the student. the \\\\nsecond -department may also list an additional set of prer equisite courses in some cases.  \\\\n\\\\u25cf Intake: Minimum 5 Nos. or 10% of intake of the host department (whichever is higher) and the selection will \\\\nbe based on  the IV semester CGPA. SUGC, convener will be the overall coordinator for centralizing the \\\\nselections and the Academic office will help.  \\\\n\\\\n30 \\\\n \\\\u25cf The Double Major registration has to be done before the Add period of 5th Semester (1 -2 segment).  \\\\n\\\\u25cf Students can also sta rt accumulating course credits in the form of additional courses and convert them to be \\\\ncounted in favour of Double Major requirements at the time of enrolling into this program.  \\\\n\\\\u25cf The student should not have any backlogs.  \\\\n\\\\u25cf Each (second) department can set a cap on the maximum number of students who can avail this option.  \\\\n\\\\u25cf A student cannot do double -major and minor in the same department.  \\\\n\\\\u25cf If a student registers for Double Major (but not for a Minor), completes a few courses, and then opts out of a \\\\ndouble maj or, say, after completing 12 credits, and if these 12 credits also happen to be listed in the Minors \\\\nbasket of courses, then the student should be awarded a Minor.  \\\\n\\\\u25cf After enrolling into double -major, if a student gets Fail (F) grade in more than 3 credits h is/ her enrolment to \\\\nthe same will be terminated.  \\\\n\\\\u25cf The nomenclature for award of  Double Major d egree for the depar tments which doesn\\\\u2019t offer BTech program \\\\nwill be - \\\\u2018BTech in ABC and Second Major in XYZ\\\\u2019  \\\\n\\\\u25cf Similar to Minor/ Honors rules, if a student opts out  of the Double Major program, they can convert at most 6 \\\\ncredits into free electives if he/she has completed the two third number of total credits as Double Major \\\\notherwise they will remain additional.

permissible time will be \\\\ndeemed to be automatically terminated from the program. Students facing disciplinary action for any serious \\\\noffence (example ragging) may also face premature termination from the program, if so recommended by the \\\\ndisciplinary a ction committee.  \\\\n \\\\nA student whose Program is terminated may appeal to the Chairperson, Senate, for reinstatement in the Program. \\\\nIn cases of termination due to inadequate academic performance, the student should clearly explain causes for the \\\\npoor perform ance, including how those causes will not adversely affect her/his performance in the future. The \\\\nSenate shall take a final decision about reconsideration of termination after considering all available inputs; the \\\\ntermination of the student remains in effe ct till otherwise recommended by the senate.  \\\\n \\\\nStudents who do not register for more than 2 consecutive semesters without information/prior approval will be \\\\nterminated. However, the student may appeal within one month from the date of termination notice  for \\\\nconsideration .

These courses and their \\\\ngrades will also be mentioned in the transcript of the student (but will not be considered in the CGPA calculation).  \\\\nThe students with less than 7.0 CGPA are not allowed to register additional (extra) courses than their respective \\\\nnominal semester course load  \\\\nSimilarly, a student can also Audit a cours e; audit is similar to additional courses  except for that the grade will be \\\\nshown as AU in the transcript.  \\\\n \\\\n\\\\n29 \\\\n 4.3.2 BTech Teaching Assistantship   \\\\nInterested senior undergraduate students with a good CGPA can act as Teaching Assistants for beginner courses. \\\\nDepartment may decide the criteria for Teaching Assistantship. Usually, the students are expected to put in six \\\\nhours of work every week for this.  No stipend will be provided for this work. However, a certificate of appreciation \\\\nwill be issued in this rega rd from the Director.  \\\\n \\\\n4.3.3 Honor/ Minor  \\\\nA UG student can enrol for Minor program in a department other than his/her parent department and Honors \\\\nprogram in parent department. Following are the guidelines:  \\\\n\\\\u25cf In order to earn a minor degree, a student has to earn a minimum of 12 extra credits from a basket of courses \\\\nprescribed for each minor stream (if a student has already done some of the required courses as free electives \\\\nbefore, he may approach DU GC/ Concerned Department for equivalent credits).  \\\\n\\\\u25cf In ord er to earn honors degree, a student has to earn a minimum of 12 extra credits in the student\\\\u2019s major \\\\ndepartment out of which six credits will be from the project  courses.  \\\\n\\\\u25cf Minor registration has to be done before the Add period of 5th Semester (1 -2 segment) . \\\\n\\\\u25cf Minor:  Intake will be m inimum 5 Nos. or 10% of intake of the host department (whichever is higher)  and the \\\\nselection will be based on the IV semester CGPA.  SUGC, convener will be the overall coordinator for centralizing \\\\nthe selections and the Academic office will help.  \\\\n\\\\u25cf A student can enrol for Honor in fifth or sixth semester, depending on the policy of the department.  \\\\n\\\\u25cf A student can also enrol for both Minor  & Honors or for two Minors.  \\\\n\\\\u25cf A student must have cleared all outstanding backlogs by the time of enrolment into Minor/ Honors.  \\\\n\\\\u25cf After enrolling into Honor/ Minor, if a student gets Fail (F) grade in more than 3 credits his/ her enrolment  to \\\\nthe same will be terminated.  \\\\n\\\\u25cf The main transcript will only show the basic CGPA corresponding to the minimum requirement for the degree. \\\\nThe Minors/ Honors courses will be listed separately  in the transcript and carry a separate CGPA.  \\\\n\\\\u25cf Honors will be reflected in the deg ree certificate as \\\\u201c BTech in XYZ Engineering (Honors) \\\\u201d. Similarly, Minor as \\\\n\\\\u201cBTech in XYZ Engineering with Minor in ABC\\\\u201d. If a student has done both honors & minor, it will be \\\\nacknowledged as \\\\u201c BTech in XYZ Engineering (Honors) with Minor in ABC \\\\u201d.

The following are some of the rules related to this program:  \\\\n\\\\u25cf An additional 24 credits as listed by the another depar tment needs to be completed by the student. the \\\\nsecond -department may also list an additional set of prer equisite courses in some cases.  \\\\n\\\\u25cf Intake: Minimum 5 Nos. or 10% of intake of the host department (whichever is higher) and the selection will \\\\nbe based on  the IV semester CGPA. SUGC, convener will be the overall coordinator for centralizing the \\\\nselections and the Academic office will help.  \\\\n\\\\n30 \\\\n \\\\u25cf The Double Major registration has to be done before the Add period of 5th Semester (1 -2 segment).  \\\\n\\\\u25cf Students can also sta rt accumulating course credits in the form of additional courses and convert them to be \\\\ncounted in favour of Double Major requirements at the time of enrolling into this program.  \\\\n\\\\u25cf The student should not have any backlogs.  \\\\n\\\\u25cf Each (second) department can set a cap on the maximum number of students who can avail this option.  \\\\n\\\\u25cf A student cannot do double -major and minor in the same department.  \\\\n\\\\u25cf If a student registers for Double Major (but not for a Minor), completes a few courses, and then opts out of a \\\\ndouble maj or, say, after completing 12 credits, and if these 12 credits also happen to be listed in the Minors \\\\nbasket of courses, then the student should be awarded a Minor.  \\\\n\\\\u25cf After enrolling into double -major, if a student gets Fail (F) grade in more than 3 credits h is/ her enrolment to \\\\nthe same will be terminated.  \\\\n\\\\u25cf The nomenclature for award of  Double Major d egree for the depar tments which doesn\\\\u2019t offer BTech program \\\\nwill be - \\\\u2018BTech in ABC and Second Major in XYZ\\\\u2019  \\\\n\\\\u25cf Similar to Minor/ Honors rules, if a student opts out  of the Double Major program, they can convert at most 6 \\\\ncredits into free electives if he/she has completed the two third number of total credits as Double Major \\\\notherwise they will remain additional. These additional courses will find mention in the tran script.\\\", \\\"mimetype\\\": \\\"text/plain\\\", \\\"start_char_idx\\\": 84240, \\\"end_char_idx\\\": 88629, \\\"text_template\\\":
